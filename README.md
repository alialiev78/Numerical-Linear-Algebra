This repository contains completed assignments from a course on numerical linear algebra. It includes two homework assignments (I scored approximately 180 out of 200 points for them) as well as my code for the course project. A more 'cleaned-up' version of the project code, combined with contributions from other team members, is available at the following link: https://github.com/GurevichPE/nysadmm
